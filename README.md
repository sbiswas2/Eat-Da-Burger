# Eat-Da-Burger

## Description

Eat-Da-Burger is an app that simulates the status of eating your burger at a restaurant.  A user can add a burger of their choice and it gets added to the database, just like ordering your food.  The app will display this burger in the first column.  The user can choose to 'devour it' by clicking the button.  Then the status of the burger gets updated and the display changes automatically.  This is like eating your burger.  You will then see the burger in the second column which lists all the burgers that are devoured.  Once a burger is devoured, you can 'toss it' and the app removes the burger from the display.  This is just like throwing away your trash at the restaurant.
